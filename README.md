# Advent of Code 2015

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2015](http://adventofcode.com/2015).

## Notes

Day 4 solution uses [md5.js](http://www.myersdaily.org/joseph/javascript/md5-text.html) by Joseph Myers.

Day 19 solution doesn't terminate after finding the solution, you will need to close the tab manually. It might lock up your browser if you leave it running...

Day 22 solution uses Web Workers, so you'll probably need to run it from localhost rather than file:// or you'll get an error:

```
Uncaught DOMException: Failed to construct 'Worker': Script at 'file://.../battle.js' cannot be accessed from origin 'null'.
```

Day 24 solution uses [js-combinatorics](https://github.com/dankogai/js-combinatorics) by [dankogai](https://github.com/dankogai).
